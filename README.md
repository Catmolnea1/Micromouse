Project Micromouse

The program consists of several classes that are aimed at sending requests to a local server (simulator) and controlling a robot on this server.

This project was developed by me and 1 other person, for development in programming in python. The program itself is the mind of the robot in the MTS Maze simulator. To run the code, you need to download this program. Then you need to find the token and insert it into the Mouse1.py file in the TOKEN variable. After that, I myself do not know whether the program will start. If you are interested, you can poke around in it.
